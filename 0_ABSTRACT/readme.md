                                                   CONTROLLING DOOR USING SWITCH
                                                   
                                                              ABSTRACT
                                                              
 In this project we control the door using switches.An Blinking LED will indicate whether the door is open or close.Here we use Atmega328 microcontroller to build 
 project in software.Here we use SimuleIDE software to simulate the circuit.Atmel software is used to dumb the code.By this project we can control our door from our
 room itself.
 
 Atmega228 microcontroller plays a crucial role in projet.The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family (later Microchip 
 Technology acquired Atmel in 2016). It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.ATmega328 is commonly used in many projects and autonomous systems  
 where a simple, low-powered, low-cost micro-controller is needed. Perhaps the most common implementation of this chip is on the popular Arduino development platform,    
 namely the Arduino Uno, Arduino Pro Mini and Arduino Nano models.
